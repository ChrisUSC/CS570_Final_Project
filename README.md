## CS570 - Algorithms
### Final Project

`basic.py` and `effecient.py` are the main programs. They can either be run in debug mode which prints console outputs, or in normal mode where the `output.txt` file is generated.  

For their exact command line usage, you can run:
```
python <script.py> --help
```

The default behaviour is to generate the output.txt file as required by the project instructions, when run as follows:
```
python <script.py> <input_file>
```
